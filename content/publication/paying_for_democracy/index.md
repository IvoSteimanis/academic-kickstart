abstract: "International aid conditional on holding democratic elections has been for long a preferred policy tool to spread democratization. A paramount obstacle to these policies is the potential of recipients to manipulate elections, enabling them to keep receiving aid without giving up power. We report results from an experiment conducted with 64 local leaders in rural Namibia that show the effect of conditional payments for democratic choices on leaders’ choice of rules for group decision-making. Each leader selects among three rules of decision making, namely democratic, pseudo-democratic (appearing democratic but keeping decision power), and dictator. The group decision is on how to allocate resources between leaders and a set of their constituents. Leaders make rule choices over three rounds, where we gradually introduce conditional payments for appearing democratic (including both the pseudo- and democratic rules). First, our results show that without conditional payments, the majority of leaders are truly democratic. Second, we find that on average the conditional payments lead to an increase in pseudo-democratic choices. However, we find heterogeneous effects depending on the leader’s motivation to run for office. Leaders that are intrinsically motivated are significantly less likely to choose the autocratic rule in the baseline condition compared to extrinsically motivated leaders. Introducing conditional payments has adverse effects on intrinsic leaders (crowding-out), while extrinsic leaders respond to the incentives as expected and choose less often the dictatorial rule (crowding-in)."
