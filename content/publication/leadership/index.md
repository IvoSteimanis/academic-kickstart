abstract: "In this study, we test the common conception that democratically elected leaders behave in the interest of their constituents to a greater extent than traditional chiefs do. Our sample consists of 64 (real-life) village leaders and 384 villagers in rural Namibia, where democratically elected leaders and traditional chiefs co-exist within the same villages. We analyze two main attributes of local political leaders: their procedural fairness preferences and their preferential treatment of relatives (nepotism). In addition, we measure personality traits, employing an incentivized social preference task and standardized surveys on local governance practices and villagers’ perceptions of their leaders’ performance. Our results contradict the theoretical priors, as they indicate that traditional chiefs are as likely to implement fair, democratic decision-making procedures (68% of chiefs and 58% of democratic leaders), and they are as unlikely to behave nepotistic (25% of chiefs and 40% of democratic leaders). Moreover, elected leaders and chiefs express similar fundamental social preferences and personality traits. These findings are in line with villagers’ perceptions of most leaders in our sample being popular and fair, albeit villagers’ responses reveal a substantial discrepancy between planned and de-facto implementation of democratic institutions at the local level in Namibia."
