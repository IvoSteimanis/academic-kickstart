abstract: "Research on climate-induced migration has not converged towards agreement among scientists, decision-makers, and the public to date. While alarmist predictions of mass movements are common narratives, we argue that such claims cannot be made based on past voluntary migration. We present primary survey data from three rural Asian-Pacific hot spots of sea-level rise: the river deltas in Bangladesh and Vietnam as well as atolls in Solomon Islands. We systematically describe how people respond to questions on international voluntary migration and whether these may yield plausible predictions for future forced displacement scenarios. Our findings show (1) that most people will stay in hazardous environments reinforcing a poverty trap (2) that this is partly driven by sunk costs effects of previous investments and (3) that responses to future migration scenarios need to be carefully adjusted for their plausibility."
