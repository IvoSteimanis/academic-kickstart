abstract: "People’s willingness to engage in prosocial behavior can be informative about how resilient societies are towards climate hazards. We study the impact of fast- and slow-onset natural hazards on prosocial behaviors using incentivized behavioral tasks, conducted with people who experienced Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines (study 1; n=378) or come from sea-level rise hotspots (study 2; n=1047) in three Asian-Pacific countries. We experimentally manipulate the salience of these hazards, present evidence for external validity and discuss potential mechanisms. In both studies, we find that people are more prosocial towards fellow community members when hazards are salient."
