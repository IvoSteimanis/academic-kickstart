abstract: "We study the impact of climate change on pro-social behaviors, such as experiencing a fast or slow onset hazard. Climate change will amplify environmental hazards which are already affecting the livelihoods of marginalized people across the globe. These impacts could affect people’s willingness to engage in pro-social behaviors, which may ultimately inform about potentials for adaption, migration, or even conflicts arising from vulnerabilities to hazards. We examine this relationship using incentivized lab-in-the field and survey experiments conducted with people who experienced typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines (n=336) or come from sea-level hotspots (n=833) in the Pacific on Solomon Islands and coastal regions in Bangladesh and Vietnam. The participants make decisions about pro-social behavior after learning about potential SLR impacts or rethinking Typhoon Haiyan. Our results suggest that people who were informed about the impacts are more pro-social towards fellow villagers. This strengthening effect is smaller for people already more affected by SLR impacts, potentially due to the role of negative emotions. We find no evidence for increased out-group discrimination"
