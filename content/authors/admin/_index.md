I am a postdoc in the research group of Sustainable Use of Natural Resources at Marburg University. I wrote my disseration on the behavioral impacts of climate change. How does the prospect displacement affect people's pro-social behavior? How do people assess the impact and risk of sea-level rise impacts? How do they plan to adapt? Do people intend to stay, move internally or even abroad? 
In my research I use a combination of experimental methods, surveys and focus group discussion to learn from people with relevant experiences. I have first hand experience in conducting research in the Pacific (Solomon Islands), Sub-Saharan Africa (Namibia) and South-East Asia (Bangladesh, Vietnam). Currently I am working on a project that explores, through various lenses, the long-term effects of a terminated asset-building PES project in Mozambique.
