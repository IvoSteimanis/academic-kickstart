I am a postdoc in the research group of Sustainable Use of Natural Resources at Marburg University.  My main research interest lies in the behavioral impacts of climate change. How does the prospect displacement affect people's pro-social behavior? How do people assess the impact and risk of sea-level rise impacts? How do they plan to adapt? Do they plan to migrate abroad? 
To get a grasp on these questions, I go to the field and use a combination of experimental methods, surveys and focus group discussion with people that are strongly affected by rising sea-levels. So far, I have collected data on low-lying atolls in Solomon Islands and in two of the most affected coastal regions in Bangaldesh (Ganges Delta) and Vietnam (Mekong Delta).
