    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract">International aid conditional on holding democratic electionsdemocratic principles has been for long a policy tool to spread democratizationto achieve development goals. An obstacle that this policy faces is the capacity of recipients to manipulate elections, enabling them to receive aid without giving up power. We report results from an experiment conducted with 64 local leaders in rural Namibia that explore the effect of conditional monetary payments on choices for group decision-making. Conditional payments to for appearinging democratic are introduced in an environment where each leader selects among three rules for group decision-making: democratic (simple majority), pseudo-democratic (appearing democratic but keeping decision power), and dictatorial (decision by the leader). The group decision is on how to allocate resources between leaders and a set of their constituents villagers (N=384). Leaders make rule choices over three rounds, where we gradually introduce conditional payments for appearing democratic (including both the pseudo- and democratic rules). Our results show that without payments, 64 percent of leaders choose the democratic rule. Introducing conditionalWith payments, independent of the amount, does not increase the average share of democratic choices is unaffected and but decreases the number of dictatorial choices decreases at the expense of an increase in pseudo-democratic choices. These average effects mask substantial heterogeneity depending on leaders’ baseline choices, as one-quarter of baseline democrats switches to the pseudo-democratic or even dictatorial rule with conditional payments.</p>
